# TechOps-bug-tracker
  This is a fullstack solution perfect for a team with multiple members, especially if they're spread apart on a couple of different projects. This app allows it's users to monitor, issue, and solve bugs inside of any app.

### How does it work?
  After registering and logging in, you'll be met with the main page, where all of the team's projects are shown. From here, you yourself can create a new project, by specifying a name, team, and project repo. 

### What can I do as a tester?
  Choose and project you wish to work on(and are not already a member of), go to the "Testing" tab, and simply press the "Become tester" button. You now have the ability to issue new bugs, commits and all, for the developers to solve. 

### What can I do as a developer?
  Open any of the available projects that you're a member of and start squashing bugs. The "Members" tab shows you all of the bugs which have been previously been registered by the the testers of a project, they're accompanied by the Github commit in which they were introduced, descriptions on how to replacete them, and even priority and severity statuses. After you've solve the bug, simply mark it as such by providing the commit. The priority status will from then on be marked as "solved", so the team can keep a tab on all previous bugs the they had met in the making of the project.

### What if I get lost in the UI?
  The UI of the app is dinamically altered based on your respective role on a project, so you won't have to worry getting your screen clutered with useless info

### How was this done?
  The project was a collaboration between me and https://github.com/xmargix. The backend is his full contribution to the project(NodeJS with Express), and the frontend(Angular 16), mine.
